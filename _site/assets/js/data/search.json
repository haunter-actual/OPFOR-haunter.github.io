    "content": "  Introduction  Explosion is the 4th 5th system (HTB keeps adding new machines) in the Tier 0 list, and the 1st of 2 VIP machines. RDP is the service theme here.  tl;dr                                                                                          Spoiler!                                                                                                                                                                      1. The target is running a `RDP` server    2. using `xfreerdp`, we get several informative errors. We learn that we need `/cert:ignore` and `/u:administrator`              3. Connection is successful and the flag is on the desktop    5. ![explosion](/assets/img/ctf/htb/sp/tier0/explosion/explosion.gif)Goddamn it Moon Moon   Establishing a Connection  Spawn the bastard and get vpn going.  I’ve confirmed the target is reachable with a ping.  Initial Scan  nmap -v -T4 -A -oA recon/all $target   The Tasklist  Task 1 What does the 3-letter acronym RDP stand for?  RDP is short for Remote Desktop Protocol. You can read moar about RDP here.  Task 2 What is a 3-letter acronym that refers to interaction with the host through a command line interface?  Command Line Interface is abbreviated to cli. The terminal window seen in most of my screenshots is a cli (see-el-eye, not the thing your girlfriend says you can never find).  Task 3 What about graphical user interface interactions?  Similary, Graphical User Interface is abbreviated to gui (goo-ee, like that sock under your bed). Any program that utilzes preset menus / buttons in a visual manner, rather that terminal input, is using a gui.  Task 4 What is the name of an old remote access tool that came without encryption by default?  If you recall Meow, we used the telnet tool to connect to the target. telnet used to transmit data in-the-clear out of the box. Anyone that would be capturing packets would be able to see all data being transmitted…including passwords.  Task 5 What is the concept used to verify the identity of the remote host with SSH connections?  public-key cryptography  This is too complicated to cover here, so please reference the link here if you need a primer. Also note that this concept is not limited to just SSH, but many forms of secure connection types.  Task 6 What is the name of the tool that we can use to initiate a desktop projection to our host using the terminal?  I assumed this was installed on Kali, but didn’t know the name. A trick to find a tool that may contain some part you may know (“rdp” in this instance), is to search the /bin/ directory.  The /bin/ dir contains binaries (tools) , so we could run ls /bin/*rdp* to search for a possible tool.    We found xfreerdp. This is our answer.  Task 7 What is the name of the service running on port 3389 TCP?    ms-webt-server  Task 8 What is the switch used to specify the target host’s IP address when using xfreerdp?  Open up the man page. man xfreerdp    Right at the top we see the default command syntax. The /v:server[:port] portion seems promising. The terminology server is a bit off from host's IP address, but note Windows machines typically have a RDP server service built-in. That confirms this is the correct switch.  /v:  Task 9 Submit root flag    Based off our initial nmap scan, we know RDP(1) is open, but also SMB(2) on 445. Given that this machine is RDP oriented, this is unlikely to lead anywhere. However, it’s good practice to explore for a glaring opening, and also reinforce what we learned in previous lessons.    As we thought, dead-end. No shares to plunder. On to RDP.  Capturing the Flag  Let’s try a simple connection to see if we get lucky. We will use the default values besides specifying our target server so we do not need to specify port.  xfreerdp /v:$target    A connection attempt is initiated. Two things to note:    As a username was not specified, the RDP session is trying to log us on the target system using our local username haunter. I doubt this will work without specifying an account that would be found on the target system.   we are prompted for DOMAIN and PASSWORD.   Let’s check back to our scan results.    The DOMAIN is listed here as EXPLOSION. Let’s enter that but leave our password empty.  When we enter the info we get a lot of log data and the command terminates. There is too much info at once to easily parse.  We’ll take this time to create a log file and try again to see if we can get some insight on what went wrong.       We check the man pages for any built-in logging facilities with man xfreerdp | grep log.   It looks like xfreerdp uses something called wlog to do so, and it actually tells us to run man wlog for details.   After reading the man page, we learn that we need to prepend the xfreerdp command with some values. They are the following:    WLOG_APPEND=file   *This tells wlog what we are to output the log to.   WLOG_LEVEL=ERROR   *This says to print log infos at the ERROR level and below (see the man page for details). Error messages should tell us what broke the connection attempt for us to fix.   WLOG_FILEAPPENDER_FILE_PATH=./   *This is the path to our log file. Using current working directory here.   WLOG_FILEAPPENDER_FILE_NAME=output.log   *The name of our log file.        The command now reads as            WLOG_APPEND=file WLOG_LEVEL=ERROR WLOG_FILEAPPENDER_FILE_PATH=./ WLOG_FILE_APPENDER_FILE_NAME=output.log xfreerdp /v:$target. We run the command and then output the contents. There are two ERRORS:           ERRCONNECT_PASSWORD_CERTAINLY_EXPIRED            We saw earlier that because we did not specify a user in the command, the session was attempting to log us into the remote target using our local user haunter. This error is likely a result of that as the account does not exist on the target or in the EXPLOSION domain. We’ll need to specify a user next time. The man page shows that the /u:USERNAME flag will allow us to specify a user to login with.           SSL routines:ssl3_read_bytes...            This looks like a certificate issue. Teh googles suggest trying the /cert:ignore flag to remedying this issue.             Now our revised command reads as follows:  WLOG_APPEND=file WLOG_LEVEL=ERROR WLOG_FILEAPPENDER_FILE_PATH=./ WLOG_FILE_APPENDER_FILE_NAME=output.log xfreerdp /v:$target /cert:ignore /u:Administrator  Note: I tried a few different default/built-in account names that Windows machines have baked in. In this instance, Administrator worked (see below) without a password.    Upon executing the command, we got in and we can see the flag on the desktop. With that, we can wrap this one up after submitting the value.  ![explosion2](/assets/img/ctf/htb/sp/tier0/explosion/explosion2.gif)MRW submitting a flag  Lessons Learned     xfreerdp can be used for RDP footholds.   WLOG facilities can be used to help troubleshoot connection issues  "

It looks like SMB will be the theme of the day.  tl;dr                                                                                          Spoiler!                                                                                                                                                                        1.

Initial Scan    The Tasklist  Task 1 What does the 3-letter acronym SMB stand for?  SMB stands for Server Message Block.  Task 2 What port does SMB use to operate at?  Some googling shows that SMB uses port 445by default.  Task 3 What network communication model does SMB use, architecturally speaking?  Simiarly to FTP, SMB uses the Client-Server model. A standalone system, the server, will run the SMB service. Clients will connect to transfer/receive data, including filesharing and print data.  Task 4 What is the service name for port 445 that came up in our nmap scan?  Here’s our service info:    Port 445 has the microsoft-ds service. The Microsoft Directory Service is used primarily for file transfer over the network and printing services. There are currently three versions SMB, with SMBv1 being a notoriously insecure version that can be easily exploited.  Task 5 What is the tool we use to connect to SMB shares from our Linux distribution?  Let’s see what tools may be available that could be the answer.  I typed in smb and hit TAB. This is lets the terminal use autocomplete, and it will list any matching commands.    We learned earlier that SMB uses a client-server model. The smbclient tool seems to be the correct tool for us to use in order to connect to the server.  Task 6 What is the flag or switch we can use with the SMB tool to list the contents of the share?  Time to man-up again. GET IT?!  man smbclient | grep list    Recall that the | (read: “pipe”) operator will redirect the output of the command to the left (man smbclient) to the command on the right (grep list). Also, recall that grep is a pattern-searching tool used to sift through output for a match. In this case, we are looking for any matches to the string “list”.  We find that the -L switch is what we are looking for.  Task 7 What is the name of the share we are able to access in the end?  Now it’s time to access the target.  smbclient -L $target   There are 4 listed shares:    ADMIN$   C$   IPC$   WorkShares   We’ll try ‘em all.  The syntax for connecting follows the following format:  smbclient \\\\\\\\$target\\\\SHARE_NAME  Notes:    \\\\\\\\$target There are 4 backslash (\\) characters at the begining of the server string we are connecting to. Due to Unix-style shells interpreting a single \\ character as an escape character, we need to double them to prepresent \\\\$target.   For this same reason, the \\\\SHARE_NAME portion of the the string equates to \\SHARE_NAME with the shell translation in mind.   We can actually use forward slashes (/) instead without worrying about escapecharacters. The syntax would be //$target/SHARE_NAME. We use \\ here for a lesson on escaping.        ADMIN$ - we get an NT_STATUS_ACCESS_DENIED here. No joy.   C$ - same news NT_STATUS_ACCESS_DENIED, No joy.   IPC$ - we actually have a connection! HOWEVER, we have a problem running command ls. We get NT_STATUS_INVALID_INFO_CLASS. Technically, this means the share isn’t configured for the data we are transmitting, but we can chalk this up as a dead-end for now.   WorkShares - We have joy! Got a connection and are able to run commands. We run ls and see two folders here, Amy.J and James.P.   Task 8 What is the command we can use within the SMB shell to download the files we find?    Let’s find the flag to download.     ls Amy.J\\ - We check the contents of the first folder. There is only the file worknotes.txt. Not what we need.   ls James.P\\ - there is the flag.txt.   Our answer for this task is get. We run get James.P\\flag.txt to initiate the download to the local directory we were in when we launched the smbclient tool.   We exit the smbclient session.   Task 9 Submit root flag Now back in our local session, we find the flag we downloaded and cat out the value. And now Dancing has been owned (#5 in the image above).  ![goths](/assets/img/ctf/htb/sp/tier0/dancing/goths.gif)Let me show you the dance of my people.

This is another educational system, so I will cover the commands in-depth than I will in future machines, but will build off knowledge from the previous machine, Meow.  tl;dr    Spoiler!      1. `FTP` to target.   2. username \"anonymous\".    3. `GET` flag to localhost.   4. ????   5. ![fawn](/assets/img/ctf/htb/sp/tier0/fawn/fawn.webp)sometimes it do be like that    Establishing a Connection  Spawn the bastard and get vpn going.    I’ve confirmed the target is reachable with a ping.  Initial Scan  Unlike the last machine, let’s do our default nmap scan now and store the results in recon/all again and move on to the tasklist.  The Tasklist  Task 1 What does the 3-letter acronym FTP stand for? The next couple of questions are related to FTP. Let’s run man ftp | less.    We can see the description for FTP is ‘an internet file transfer program’. However, the answer we are looking for is further on and is File Transfer Protocol.  Task 2 What communication model does FTP use, architecturally speaking? FTP uses the client-server model. In this model, clients typically are endpoint systems used by people to conduct tasks and look at Reddit. Servers can also be endpoint systems, but are typically standalone systems that run the FTP service for client(s) to connect and upload/download files.  Task 3 What is the name of one popular GUI FTP program? FileZilla is a widely used GUI FTP program.  Task 4 Which port is the FTP service active on usually? FTP runs off port 23/TCP by default.  Task 5 What acronym is used for the secure version of FTP? Secure FTP is known as SFTP. Crazy right?  Our First Scan Task 6 What is the command we can use to test our connection to the target? We should already know that this tool is the ping command.  Task 7 From your scans, what version is FTP running on the target? Let’s take a look at our scan results from earlier (remember you can use cat [filename] | less to print the contents of a file in a paginated fashion if you stored your results in a file).    We ran \tnmap with the -A flag earlier, which runs service detection (among other things).  We always want to pay attention to the section below that details detected services and ports:    It looks like the service vsftpd is running version 3.0.3.  Task 8 From your scans, what OS type is running on the target? At the bottom of our scan results, we have data labeled Service Info. The OS is detailed as Unix.  Task 9 Submit root flag Now we have to get the flag, let’s review some important info:   What do we know?    flag.txt is located on teh FTP server.   The FTP service allows anonymous logins.   Anon login is good to see. Let’s try to connect.    I tried authenticating without entering a username or password. This is clearly not what anonymous login means. Shit.  Whever you need info, always check the tools man pages first.  We are searching for the string \"user\" in a hope that there will be a command filter or flag related to logging in with a user account, and any special syntax needed for the command.    We run man for ftp (1), but for the sake of expediency we then pipe the output and use grep to search through the output for the term \"user\" (2). grep is an extremely useful tool used for searching for patterns, and this is a very basic use case involving a simple string.  At the bottom of our filtered output (3), we can see that there is an FTP-specific command user. This command is entered on the ftp interface and will then prompt for a username to login with.  With that knowledge, let’s give it a try:       We enter the user command at the ftp input prompt.   The prompt then asks for a username, we enter anonymous and do not enter a password.   We have joy- we are now on the FTP server.   Capturing the Flag      First thing to do is look at our current directory with ls. There is one file listed- our flag.txt.   If you try to cat the contents of the flag.txt file, you may get an error. Remember that some tools that are available on your local system may not be installed on a remote system. We use get flag.txt to download the file to oour local system in this case.   The file downloads successfully, let’s get the contents.   Use the exit command to terminate the FTP session   With a local ls, we see that flag.txt was downloading in the directory we initiated the FTP session in.   We cat the flag and have owned Fawn successfully.   ![fawn](/assets/img/ctf/htb/sp/tier0/fawn/fawn.gif)HAUNTER's first foothold attempts, colorized 2022   Lessons Learned     Anonymous FTP allowed on an nmap scan is a good potential foothold vector   "
