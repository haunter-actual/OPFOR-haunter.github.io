I am a blue team cybersecurity professional with a very diverse IT background getting closer to two decades of experience (fuck me I'm old...). I am married to a beautiful and supporting wife and the proud parent of three cats, a dog, and a lot of plants. 

This site is focused on cybersecurity, including various ctf writeups, offensive security methodology, and other related things as I explore RedOps and become educated in offsensive security techniques and technologies. Feel free to reach out or connect with me. I can be readily found on Offsec's discord as well.
